Vijay G,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Things to remember before you buy an Iphone -1) It is good only untill its warranty is there, for extended warranty, it is 10k approx for one year.2) Under warranty also, it's resell value is only 25k in Apple store, so this itself explains that the mobile is over-priced, and that's why resell value under warranty is 25k which is it's actual value.3) Once the warranty expires - Apple will keep on bringing in updated versions and the updated versions will mall function in a 1 year old Iphone as well. Problems include - Green screen, network issues, etc.4) Many people Iphones underwent Green Screen after the latest update and as their Iphone was not under warranty had to spend 400$ or 11k to 15k depending upon their model for screen repair or change. Meaning Apple company will release update, because of which the Iphone will malfunction and people have to spend money inorder to repair it.5) Iphone - covers, tampered glass are all very expensive and are of third class quality and design. Even after spending 1500 to 2000 INR for an Iphone cover, it will last only for 6-8 months. After that, either it will become dull, dirty or look ugly or pale. An android cover of 250 Rs also functions the same way.6) Apps - That is a total scam everyone knows that. You have to pay for many apps and many apps are still unavailable in App StoreMoral of the story -You can buy an expensive Iphone and use it comfortable for a year or maximum 2. So, if you are ready to spend so much money just for a year, it is the best mobile. For long run, this is just a scam that it will last for a long run.Joke of the year - You will be prompted with features that Iphone and Macbook's only have! - The only issue is, comman man never uses those features! So, people inorder to prove that this is a very unique feature, unnecessarily use it, show it and claim that it could be done only because they have an Iphone. Kudos to them for doing something alien!"
Shriram,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Now filpcart is offering open box delivery but Amazon just giving so called secure delivery.. the delivery person even not allowed me to see the package is tampered or ok at time of delivery… my friend also have the same experience with Amazon n delivery person. Although I got genuine product, but everybody concerned about right product delivery. Amazon is my first choice when it comes to online shopping, but Amazon should be taken care of that and have to introduce open box delivery. ?????? moreover Amazon offers open box delivery for dishwasher, TVs etc.. where chances are very less to have product issues or missing.. lastly you will get open box delivery for a Tv of 32” purchased @ around 10k but not for a IPhone like products even costing from few thousand to around one n half lack???? still don’t go with Flipkart they are looting customers even after giving open box delivery… many fraud sellers are registered on Flipkart … so if having to much concern directly go to store n purchase there, even at store you can get card discounts n cash back like offers. In worst case you will pay 2 3k more as compared to online shopping but you will surely get original products… choice is yours….????"
Sakshi,1.0 out of 5 stars,The media could not be loaded.  I’m buying iphone 13 but iphone 13 is damage.

But apple store are refund it and he said ke one week ke liya chorna hoga repair krnke ke liya…… ab main aase situation main hun ke main bta nhi skte apne family ko because am belong to middle class family.
Aishwarya Narayanan,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This was my first iPhone purchase and it was working fine for 1.5 years - although I had complains about the battery life which kept getting worse with time to the point that I had to carry a power bank with me always.Randomly one day out of the blue, the phone crashed & now it's not turning on - when I took it to the service centre they said it's due to motherboard issue and it will cost us 40k to replace it. My phone is prime condition, I have not dropped it, there is not even a scratch on it. I wonder how there can be a hardware issue while it was working fine just few moments before crash. Also, this happened a few days after I installed iOS 17 - so that is also a suspect."
Dhinesh.S,1.0 out of 5 stars,"After a long wait for Great indian festival , I ordered a iPhone 13 and received on 13th October, the delivery also horrible. after receiving the product , for one day .I charged phone fully on 90% but it always stop to 30% within 5 hours on low power mode without using any social network application camera including web browser the battery information gives report of clearly shows in graph , usage of phone. but power Downed for few hours after the full charge .then I contacted the Apple team. they suggested to reset the phone and update the latest 17 iOS. butI am not satisfied with the solution and then I contacted the Amazon customer care they gave a simple of it .It is a brand warranty warranty so you should contact the Apple service centre . I paid 48000 for this one. Really I am disappointment with the both seller and brand also"
Dinesh Bagoria,1.0 out of 5 stars,I visited company service center but they denied to support in this case. They are just saying that it's WhatsApp issue. You have to communicate with WhatsApp. I was surprised whether WhatsApp is a free application to whom we need to support instead of Apple support where as we paid to Apple.
Shrikant k.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"It has been 20 days i have buy this phone , facing some extreme level heating issues.When it is charging the charging gets automatically stopped just because of heat. Sometimes i do not use device in the thought of it will blast. So scary to hold this device sometimes."
hamimsyed,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The media could not be loaded.  Was very happy that the iPhone was delivered on time but to my disappointment there was no cable. Chalo, charged it with my old charger. And again I was in shock when the screen doesn't work, it's struck at hola, hello, swipe up to open ??tried switching it off... But no use, touch screen is defective. When contacted Amazon customer care they say they launched a enquiry, but nothing can be done in case of defective product and I have to contact Apple service center, seriously? Regret trusting Amazon and being a prime member for nearly 4 years"
Mohsin Mian,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst buy ever battery drains very fast it does not last even 4 hours with 85 % of charge heats alot and sometimes lag and in Amazon it always lag and camera is not that good it's just a hype worst decision ever to buy apple product.
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The exchange offer is totaly fraud by amazon.90% delivery agent did not take your phone on exchnage, they put your phone have some issue even phone is completey in good condition, but you don't have any option to pay the extra reducing amount or pay full amount,Or you can give some extra money to delivery agent than your old phone is completely fine.Most important thing is that when you ask amazon customer what was wrong with your old phone they said they don't have any info. and they are not able to due anything,just taking your feedback."
Pashanta,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought iphone with exchange of old phome my exchange phone was all good no value depreciation still after giving otp the delivery person asked for 1500 more it was genuinely showing on his app but i asked him about did you made changes in exchange value he said no ,i wasnt isimply put an otp and it shows me 1500 to be paid ,i wasnt sure but i paid in surge of excitement by paytmNow i am expecting answers from amazonNever had such experienceApart from it phone was genuine and good no complaints about it"

Poonam,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Hii,I would like to share some thought's,I bought I phone?? 13 from Amazon in festival,Iam facing heating issues while using mobile, during charging and phone callls.I have addressed this issue with customer care alsow.Iam unable to replace the items because Amazon wants letter from apple service center.I think there should be replacement policy for apple phone also, because this is also man made products.I hope I will get proper support from Amazon and apple care."
Amit Joshi,1.0 out of 5 stars,I ordered Phone from Amazon and it started giving me issues just after a month. It hangs time to time while running application and now gave an issue with the Camera. Its shaking when I try to click pictures in light. Amazon sold me a refurbished phone at a new price which is completely unacceptable. I will escalate this to higher management and if possible file a suit against Amazon for fraud.

Sejal Mishra,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I never thought that I would receive such a bad iPhone from Amazon when I ordered it online. My iPhone is taking extremely blurry photos and it heats up quickly, within 10 minutes of using Instagram or snap. when I called customer service for a replacement,they refused to exchange it directly. This is the first time I bought an iPhone and I had a hard time saving up for it. I thought the camera would be great, but it is taking very blurry photos and overheating. I bought it for Rs. 60,499 because there was a bigger discount than on Flinkart but now I regret buying it from here because I think the seller sold it to me for a lower price due to their own faulty iPhone 13. My only request is that you replace my iPhone 13 as soon as possible...Send a message..."

lubode,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought a new device, opened the packet and it was a defective device. I contacted Amazon for replacement, and they redirected me to apple despite, amazon India has clearly stated that the item is replaceable within 7 days of purchase. Apple detected it as a defective piece and it had to be repaired. I reasoned with them that it's a new product and I don't want to get a repaired or refurbished product. But they said since it is bought from Amazon they cannot replace it, had it been bought on their website or store they would have surely replaced it.Came back to amazon, telling them my experience with Apple as it's a defective product. Apple is suggesting that would also have replaced it, so Amazon please replace it. They denied it flatly. when I asked about why they have mentioned 7 days replacement, on this they don't even say a word but simply repeated themselves that the best advice I have already given to you is that you have to go to Apple there is nothing amazon can do about it. The end experience is exhaustion and frustration, customers have only right to these companies' fat money and make them richer and richer. This is nothing but a legal extortion racket."

Not worth the hype."
